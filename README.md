# Energy-portfolio-risk-analysis-tool-using-Python-for-MtM-VaR-stress-testing-and-GM-R-calculations.
Energy Portfolio Analysis: Python script for MtM calculation, VaR estimation, stress testing, and GM@R analysis of energy commodities. Includes visualizations and summary statistics for advanced risk management in energy trading.


# Comprehensive Energy Portfolio Analysis

This script covers:

## 1. Mark to Market (MtM) Calculation
- Computes daily MtM values for a portfolio of energy commodities (oil, gas, renewables)

## 2. Value at Risk (VaR) Calculation
- Calculates VaR at 95% and 99% confidence levels
- Provides insight into potential portfolio losses

## 3. Stress Testing
- Implements various scenarios to assess portfolio performance under different market conditions
- Scenarios include base case, oil price spike, gas price crash, and renewable energy boom

## 4. Gross Margin at Risk (GM@R) Calculation
- Simplified version to estimate potential impact on gross margins

## 5. Visualization
- Plots MtM values over time
- Displays VaR on return distribution
- Shows stress test results across scenarios
- Illustrates gross margin trends

## 6. Summary Statistics
- Outputs key risk metrics including VaR, GM@R, and stress test results

This analysis demonstrates advanced risk management techniques for energy portfolios using Python.
